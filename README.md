## Project Overview

This project transforms raw Olympic historical data into interactive analytical dashboards through a modern cloud-based data engineering pipeline. The solution leverages Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Tableau to deliver powerful sports performance insights.

The analysis focuses on four key areas:
- **Host Country Performance Dynamics**: Quantifying the "home field advantage" phenomenon
- **Medal Conversion Efficiency**: Identifying which countries are most efficient at converting participants to medals
- **Longest Gaps & Comebacks**: Revealing surprising medal drought comebacks across Olympic history
- **Medal Dynasties**: Discovering long-term dominance patterns in specific sports

The pipeline demonstrates an industry-standard approach to data engineering, from ingestion through transformation and analysis to visualization.
